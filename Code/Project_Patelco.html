									<ul>
										<li>Creating a mobile banking experience that is relevant to working class families who traditionally prefer to use bank branches or ATMs</li>
										<li>Duration of 2 weeks</li>
										<li>Lack of access to study banking accounts as users were hesitant to open their banking accounts in front of us</li>
										<li>Lack of access to real Patelco users (This was a hypothetical project at General Assembly)</li>

							</div>
							<div class='overview-box'>
								<h2 id="the-insights">The insights</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>A mobile-first approach requires re-thinking the structures and interactions that desktop websites have</li>
										<li>People want to see how much money they have, move money and get cash easily</li>
										<li>Transfer of money is a transfer of information, no different from a text message or email. Why should the experience be so much more complicated?</li>
										<li>We could capitalize on the models around sharing economy to enable every cash register to be an ATM</li>

								<h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
								<p class="image-heavy">
									 Our competitive analysis compared different banking solutions out there in terms of breadth of banking services and approach to Mobile-First design. <br> The common features across different services were balance enquiry, money transfer, photo-deposit of checks and find ATMs.

							<h2>How do people want to engage with their bank?</h2>
							<h3>User research</h3><br>
							<p class="text-heavy">
								
								Our three main categories of questions were:
								<br> 
								<br>1. Current banking preferences
								<br>2. Current mobile banking behaviors
								<br>3. General digital engagement

									Our team conducted multiple qualitative interviews to understand the responses of the user in-depth. We got varied responses from "I just do my banking using my ATM card" to "I only use my bank app! I have never gone to the bank since I opened my account."

								We put out a survey through <a href="https://patelcodc.typeform.com/to/kXLPVK" target="_blank">Typeform</a> to collect more information about users. Although we got some sense of different types of banking engagement, our data wasn't as useful due the small sample size and low variation in user types (most respondents were tech-savy youth).
							</p>
							<p>
								Based on the user research, we found the following list of pain points that users had and features that users expected from their mobile banking

							<h3>Task flow analysis</h3><br>

							</p>
							<a href="../Content/Patelco/task-flow-analysis.png"><img class="img-slides" src="../Content/Patelco/task-flow-analysis.png"></a>
							<p>We also went through some banking sites and apps to understand the existing flow that people are used to.</p>

						<div class='project-step'>
							<h2>Insights from the Discovery phase</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>There’s an opportunity to capitalize on existing banking behaviors around savings and transfer to develop a streamlined banking experience</li>
									<li>Most users consistently look to manage their money on their banking apps, and not seek loans or other financial services through these apps</li>
									<li>The task of money transfer begins before the user logs into the website, when the user decides to transfer money. This allows us to think of adding value for the whole task.</li>
									<li>A lot of the complexity is exposed to the user. For e.g.. there are 3 types of transfers: ‘Internal transfer’, ‘External transfer to another bank’, ‘External transfer within same bank’ etc.</li>

							<h2>Who are we building this for?</h2>
							<h3>PERSONAS</h3>

								 Based on what we learnt from the user interviews and research on credit unions, we created personas that would give us a decision framework for designing our app.

							<h2>Not 'You Vs Me', only 'Us vs The problem'</h2>
							<p class="text-heavy">
								 To increase our productivity as a team, we used the Design Studio method to sketch out our ideas around the task of transferring money. Over many iterations, each one of us sketched our ideas out and critiqued each other’s sketches.

								In a short period of time, we were able to create multiple app wireframes of the internal wire transfer task. This method also gave us insight into the duplication of user decisions when you look at internal transfers as a separate flow from external transfers.

							<h2>Let’s test it out!</h2>
							<h3>PROTOTYPE TESTING</h3>
							<p>We created wireframes on Omnigraffle and loaded them on the mobile prototyping tool POP to test them out. We focussed on testing the ‘internal money transfer’ flow.</p>
							<div class="img-spread">
								<img src="../Content/Patelco/pop-prototyping.gif">
							</div>
							<p>
								We gleaned some insights from our testing of the internal transfer flow:
								<ul>
									<li>First decision point preference is which account the user transfers money out of</li>
									<li>Balance info is needed for each account while choosing ‘From’ and ‘To’ accounts</li>
									<li>All frequency options laid out upfront</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								We then created some wireframes to test out the home screen and gleaned some insights from our testing:
								<ul>
									<li>Our tested users liked the clear presentation of the total balance across all their accounts</li>
									<li>More clarity in balance between savings and checking accounts desired</li>
									<li>All information users was looking for was to understand how much they have to spend</li>

							<h2>AirBnB, Uber and now PATellers</h2>
							<h3>NEW CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT</h3>
							<p>
								Imagining ourselves in the midst of the community of Patelco customers, we felt that the advantage of Patelco being a Credit Union is that most of its customers come from a small community especially focussed in a single geographic area. Therefore, Patelco has a significant competitive advantage over other big banks of better relationships with the community and small-business owners of a community. We hypothesized that given the increased feasibility and acceptance of sharing economy models, Patelco could create a feature to use the cash inventory of different cash registers across any of their business customers. We brainstormed a user journey for seeking cash through PATeller system.<br>
								The idea would be to send a request for cash in a user’s vicinity and getting responses from any store/business (coined as PATeller) willing to offer the cash to her. When she reaches the store/business, she transfers the amount to the ‘PATeller’ through the Patelco mobile app and receives cash from the PATeller once the transfer is confirmed. This would help Patelco increase their cash withdrawal options without increasing number of ATMs.
